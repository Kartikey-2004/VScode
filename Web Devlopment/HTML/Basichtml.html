    <h1>Geography of India</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
      India is situated north of the equator between 8°4' north (the mainland)
      to 37°6' north latitude and 68°7' east to 97°25' east longitude.[2] It is
      the seventh-largest country in the world, with a total area of 3,287,263
      square kilometers (1,269,219 sq mi).[3][4][5] India measures 3,214 km
      (1,997 mi) from north to south and 2,933 km (1,822 mi) from east to west.
      It has a land frontier of 15,200 km (9,445 mi) and a coastline of 7,516.6
      km (4,671 mi).[1] On the south, India projects into and is bounded by the
      Indian Ocean—in particular, by the Arabian Sea on the west, the
      lakshadweep Sea to the southwest, the Bay of Bengal on the east, and the
      Indian Ocean proper to the south. The Strait and Gulf of manner separate
      India from Sri Lanka to its immediate southeast, and the Maldives are some
      125 kilometers (78 mi) to the south of India's Lakshadweep Islands across
      the Eight Degree Channel. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands, some 1,200
      kilometers (750 mi) southeast of the mainland, share maritime borders with
      Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia. The southernmost tip of the Indian
      mainland (8°4'38″N, 77°31'56″E) is just south of , while the southernmost
      point in India is Indira Point on Great Nicobar Island. The northernmost
      point which is under Indian administration is Indira Col, Glacier.[6]
      India's territorial waters extend into the sea to a distance of 12
      nautical miles (13.8 mi; 22.2 km) from the coast baseline.[7] India has
      the 18th largest Exclusive Economic Zone of 2,305,143 km2 (890,021 sq mi).
      The northern frontiers of India are defined largely by the Himalayan
      mountain range, where the country borders China, Bhutan, and Nepal. Its
      western border with Pakistan lies in the Karakoram and Western Himalayan
      ranges, Punjab Plains, the Thar Desert and the of Kutch salt marshes. In
      the far northeast, the Chin Hills and Hills, deeply forested mountainous
      regions, separate India from Burma. On the east, its border with
      Bangladesh is largely defined by the Khasi Hills and Hills, and the
      watershed region of the Gangetic Plain.[clarification needed] The Ganges
      is the longest river originating in India. The Ganges-Brahmaputra system
      occupies most of northern, central, and eastern India, while the Deccan
      Plateau occupies most of southern India. , in the Indian state of Sikkim,
      is the highest point in India at 8,586 m (28,169 ft) and the world's third
      highest peak. The climate across India ranges from equatorial in the far
      south, to alpine and tundra in the upper regions of the Himalayas.
      Geologically, India lies on the Indian Plate, the northern part of the
      indio-Australian Plate.
